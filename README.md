# 322-Project-2

1. Compute distances on the shaft and the forces from the gear
2. Find FrI and FrII (Fae is given) using moment equations - need bearing a for this
3. Find FaI and FaII, assuming axial load is not negligible
4. Find the effective loads PI and PII, P0I and P0II
5. Compute required C and C0 from L10 and fs
6. Compare with bearing C and C0 for feasability
