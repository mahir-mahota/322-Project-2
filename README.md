# 322-Project-2

1. Measure distances on the shaft and the forces from the gear
2. Find FrI and FrII (Fae is given) using moment equations
3. Find FaI and FaII, assuming axial load is not negligible
4. Find the effective loads PI and PII, P0I and P0II
5. Compute required C and C0 from L10 and fs
6. Compare with bearing C and C0 for feasability

For C:

1. The minimum shaft diameter is 54.6mm, and the maximum is 66mm - 55mm and 65mm are too close to the bounds
2. The housing width is 120mm so the bearing out diameter has to be smaller |red|
3. Without reducing housing thickness, the max bearing width T can be 30mm |green|

For D:

1. 70mm inner diameter is the smallest bearing that leads to an outer diameter of >= 150mm
2. The diameter of the pinion is 150mm so outer diameter of bearing has to be greater |yellow|
